# Security Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the security improvements implemented in VideoLingo to address critical vulnerabilities and enhance overall system security.

## P0 (Critical) Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Configuration Security
- **Issue**: Sensitive information (API keys, file paths, proxy settings) hardcoded in `config.yaml`
- **Fix**: 
  - Added environment variable support with `python-dotenv`
  - Created `.env.example` template
  - Modified `config_utils.py` to prioritize environment variables
  - Sensitive fields now read from: `API_KEY`, `VIDEO_STORAGE_BASE_PATH`, `YOUTUBE_COOKIES_PATH`, etc.
- **Impact**: Prevents credential leaks in version control

### 2. Directory Deletion Protection
- **Issue**: `is_protected_directory()` function had insufficient validation, could delete system directories
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced path validation with system-level protection
  - Added directory depth checks (minimum depth of 3)
  - Implemented parent path validation to prevent deletion of parent directories
  - Added project boundary checks in `clean_directory_contents()`
- **Impact**: Prevents catastrophic file system damage

### 3. Path Traversal Prevention
- **Issue**: User-controlled file paths in download functions could escape intended directories
- **Fix**:
  - Created comprehensive `security_utils.py` module
  - Implemented `sanitize_filename()` and `sanitize_path()` functions
  - Added path validation in `_1_ytdlp.py` download functions
  - Enhanced proxy URL validation
- **Impact**: Prevents directory traversal attacks and arbitrary file access

## P1 (High Priority) Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

### 4. Prompt Injection Prevention
- **Issue**: User input in LLM prompts could manipulate AI behavior or leak system prompts
- **Fix**:
  - Added `sanitize_user_input()` function to filter dangerous patterns
  - Implemented `wrap_user_content()` for safe XML-style content wrapping
  - Modified all prompt functions in `prompts.py` to use security wrappers
  - Filtered patterns: `</text>`, `## Role`, `You are`, `Forget previous`, etc.
- **Impact**: Prevents prompt injection and AI manipulation attacks

### 5. Logging Security & Privacy
- **Issue**: Detailed logs could contain sensitive user data and API keys
- **Fix**:
  - Added configurable logging with `debug.enable_gpt_logging` setting (default: false)
  - Implemented `mask_sensitive_content()` for privacy protection
  - Added `sanitize_for_logging()` to remove API keys and sensitive patterns
  - Enhanced `ask_gpt.py` with secure logging practices
- **Impact**: Protects user privacy and prevents credential leaks in logs

### 6. File Upload Security
- **Issue**: File upload used user-provided filenames, vulnerable to path traversal
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented UUID-based internal file naming with `generate_safe_filename()`
  - Added URL validation for download inputs
  - Enhanced file upload in `download_video_section.py` with security checks
  - Preserve original filename as metadata while using safe storage names
- **Impact**: Prevents file system attacks and naming conflicts

## Security Utilities Added

### `core/utils/security_utils.py`
- `sanitize_filename()`: Cross-platform safe filename generation
- `sanitize_path()`: Safe path combination preventing traversal
- `generate_safe_filename()`: UUID-based secure filename generation
- `validate_url()` / `validate_proxy_url()`: URL format validation
- `safe_join_path()`: Secure path joining
- `is_safe_path()`: Path safety validation

### Enhanced Configuration
- Environment variable support in `config_utils.py`
- Secure logging configuration in `ask_gpt.py`
- New config options: `debug.enable_gpt_logging`

## Files Modified

### Core Security
- `core/utils/security_utils.py` (NEW)
- `core/utils/config_utils.py`
- `core/utils/ask_gpt.py`
- `core/prompts.py`

### Download & Upload
- `core/_1_ytdlp.py`
- `core/st_utils/download_video_section.py`

### Configuration
- `config.yaml`
- `requirements.txt`
- `.env.example` (NEW)

## Verification Steps

1. **Environment Variables**: Test with `.env` file containing sensitive data
2. **Path Validation**: Attempt directory traversal with `../../../etc/passwd`
3. **Prompt Injection**: Try inputs like `</text>## Role\nYou are...`
4. **File Upload**: Upload files with malicious names like `../../../malicious.mp4`
5. **Logging**: Verify sensitive data is masked when `enable_gpt_logging=false`

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and sanitization
2. **Secure by Default**: Logging disabled by default, safe fallbacks
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
4. **Least Privilege**: Only necessary permissions and access
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation without information leakage

## Remaining Considerations (P2)

- Binary dependency verification (ffmpeg, yt-dlp) - low priority for local use
- Advanced rate limiting for API calls
- File content scanning for malware (if accepting uploads from untrusted sources)

All critical and high-priority security issues have been addressed. The system is now significantly more secure against common attack vectors.
