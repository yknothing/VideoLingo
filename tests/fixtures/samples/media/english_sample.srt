Hello, welcome to this educational video

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,200
about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,800
Today we will explore the fascinating world of neural networks

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,500
and deep learning algorithms.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,200
Machine learning is transforming many industries

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,800
including healthcare, finance, and transportation.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,500
Neural networks mimic the way human brains process information

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,200
through interconnected nodes called neurons.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,500
Deep learning uses multiple layers of these networks

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,200
to recognize complex patterns in data.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,500
This technology enables computers to understand images,

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,200
recognize speech, and translate languages.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,500
The applications are virtually limitless

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,200
and continue to grow every day.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,200
Thank you for watching this introduction to AI and ML.
